# Active Learning

## Intro
Implement active learning in different settings to see in which situation active learning is interessting.  
Parameters of interest:
* class imbalance: more usefull in heavily imbalanced datasets
* data dimensionality
* size/type of model

## Literature
* [Blog](https://dsgissin.github.io/DiscriminativeActiveLearning/)
* [Paper](https://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf)
* [Skicit](https://github.com/scikit-activeml/scikit-activeml)

## Datasets
Start with synthetic datasets in [sckikit-activeml](https://github.com/scikit-activeml/scikit-activeml).  
Next real-world datasets such as [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) of [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/).
