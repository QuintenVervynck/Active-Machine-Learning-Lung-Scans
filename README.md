# Machine Learning: Active Learning

<details><summary><h2>
1. getting familiar with the literature
</h2></summary

guidelines:

    1. see sources in project topic
    2. for more: see citations and citing papers
        1. google scholar
        2. semantic sanity
        3. connected papers
    3. be aware of arXiV (archive) (not yet peer reviewed)
    4. Don’t get stuck in this step

[this blog](https://dsgissin.github.io/DiscriminativeActiveLearning/) gave a nice introduction to Active Learning \
Read what we've learned from it over [here](./lit_study/blog.md)

2. Formulating a research question:
</h3></summary>

guidelines (examples):

    1. does method A generalise to different datasets or datatypes?
    2. how does method A compare to method B?
    3. can we speed up method A by doing X?
    4. can we automatically find a good value for hyperparameter C?
    5. …

4. writing a scientific report
</h2></summary>

guidelines:

    1. both negative or positive results are fine
    2. scientific report:
        1. introduction
        2. methods
        3. experiment setup
        4. results
        5. conclusion
    3. for examples: see NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ….
