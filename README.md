# How can active learning solve the lack of labeled images for lung disease recognition

## Abstract
In this paper we'll use pool-based active machine learning
to try to reduce the amound of labeled images that are 
needed for lung disease recognition. We'll test and 
compare different query strategies, and experiment with 
enhancing the images.
